<!-- Static : everthing starts at runtime i.e bit by bit -->
<!-- In esm, there is tree-shaking: i.e elimination of dead - ESM is considered first while runnning codes -->
<!-- Note any project we should use ESM not CJS -->

<!-- Strict by default, it s easier to spot any error -->
<!-- Module scope: variables are scoped to that module and not exposed globally -->

<!-- We can do this by changing npm_class/package.json -->
<!-- we can do so by using .cjs or .mjs to differentiate -->
