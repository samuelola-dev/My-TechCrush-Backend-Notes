<!-- NPM is just like a repository but access those packages we need to run commands-->
<!-- NPM saves time since someone has taken time to reasearch and built it for us -->
<!-- Some of these packages are open sourced -->

<!-- You can decide ti make your own and monitise it. But in this cohort, we are not building packages, it requires a lot of work -->

<!-- It is possible to build a project and share it to a person. -->
<!-- You don't need to copy the node_module folder all you need to do is to send the package.json and package.lock.json file -->

<!-- All the person need to do is to run npm install alone -->
# npm install
